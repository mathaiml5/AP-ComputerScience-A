# Benford's Law
Benford's law, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections
of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. 

Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.

This program tests Benfordâ€™s Law using data from different real-life data sources (sunspots and a library of texts). 
The data is stored in two separate text files: sunspots.txt and librarybooks.txt
 
 The program illustrates basic looping, arrays, and flow control as well as basic OO concepts.
 The basic idea is to loop through the list of numbers and count how many times 1 is the first digit, 2 is the first digit, etc...
 
 The output/results should look like this:
 
 ### Analysis of sunspot data:
 
 Percentage of numbers starting with 1: 28.24%
 
 Percentage of numbers starting with 2: 12.04%
