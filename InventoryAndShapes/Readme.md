# Inventory Items And Shapes

In this assignment we illustrate the concepts of Java's abstract Interface and the concrete implementations in a class that implements the interface.
Method overriding and overloading are also illustrated with examples of how to use the Comparable and Comparator interfaces to sort an array of custom objects using a particular field on the object.

1. Inventory Item class is a class that holds information about an electronic  store's inventory. It has product's name and id. The InventoryRunner class creates multiple instances of Inventory items and sort the array of InventoryItems using Comparable based on id or product name fields in natural sort order (alphabetical or ascending)
We also have an another option to sort the objects by using the Comparator interface.

2. The abstract Shape interface defines a calculateArea method. Classes Circle and Rectangle implement this interface and provide different implementation for how area for each shape is calculated.
