# Magic Squares with 2D Arrays

MagicSquares2DArray is an exercise to understand how to implement 2D arrays and how to write JUnit test cases to test various methods on the class. 

The class MagicSquare2DArray contains various methods such as finding row sums, column sums, checking for symmetry (i.e. it is a square) and determining if a given 2d "sqaure" array is a magic square. 

(Note: A Magic square is a 2D array where both row and column lengths are the same and every row, column, and diagonal sum to same value)

The class MagicSquare2DTester class implements variious test scenarios: all negative values in arrays, non-square array, only rows are magic, only columns are magic, latin squares and non-latin square.
(Note: A Latin Square is an n Ã— n square with n symbols arranged so that each row and column has each symbol exactly once, while in general a magic square can have symbols repeated)
