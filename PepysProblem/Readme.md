## Pepys Problem
The Pepys problem asks which is more likely: at least one 6 in 6 rolls of a fair die, or at least two 6's in 12 rolls of a fair die?
  
This program has a Pepys class wtih methods that use N simulations to approximate the probability of rolling at least 1 six in 6 rolls and a method to approximate the probability of rolling 2 sixes in 12 rolls.
