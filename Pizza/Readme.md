# Pizza 

A simple set of classes to demonstrate constructors, overloading, getters/setters and casting of varibales from one type to another.

The class Pizza has private instance variables to store the size of a pizza, the number of cheese toppings, and the number of pepperoni toppings, and the number of ham toppings.

A couple of Pizza constructors are provided to set instance variables as well as accessor and mutator methods for the instance variables, a method called calcCost() to determine the cost of the pizza, and a method called getDescription() that prints a description of the pizza in string format.

Note: The number of toppings member variables are declared as double to show casting to integer types.

The class PizzaClient simulates creating different Pizza objects using constructors and using getters/setters to populate or update various member variables.
